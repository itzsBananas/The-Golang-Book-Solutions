Good to know

-   If statements can have multiple statements
-   Function recievers transform reciving argument to correct type (but type cannot be underlying pointer or interface)
-   Lots of different ways to simplify # of words (to declare, initialize variables, structs, arrays for sure).
-   Slices and Structs are the only pointer types (structs and arrays are not)
-   No subtypes (is-relationship), but embedded variables promote methods to the holding struct (has-relationship)
-   itâ€™s possible and sometimes useful for unnamed struct types to have methods too.
